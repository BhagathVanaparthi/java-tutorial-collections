**LinkedList**
=============
  * Java LinkedList is a doubly linked list implementation of Java’s List and Deque interfaces. It is part of Java’s collections framework.

**Following are some key points to note about LinkedList in Java -**

  * Java LinkedList maintains the insertion order of the elements.

  * LinkedList can have duplicate and null values.

  * The LinkedList class implements Queue and Deque interfaces. Therefore, It can also be used as a Queue, Deque or Stack.

**Java ArrayList vs LinkedList**
===============================
  * Both ArrayList and LinkedList implement the List interface. However, they differ completely in the way they store and link to the elements.

  * An ArrayList stores the elements sequentially based on their index. However, a LinkedList uses a doubly-linked list to store its elements.

    * A doubly-linked list consists of a collection of nodes, where each node contains three fields -
      -> The data at that node.
      -> A pointer/reference to the next node in the list.
      -> A pointer/reference to the previous node in the list.
