**HashMap**
===========
  * Java HashMap class implements the Map interface which allows us to store key and value pair, where keys should be unique. If you try to insert the duplicate key, it will replace the element of the corresponding key. It is easy to perform operations using the key index like updation, deletion, etc. HashMap class is found in the java.util package.

  * Java HashMap contains values based on the key.
  * Java HashMap contains only unique keys.
  * Java HashMap may have one null key and multiple null values.
  * Java HashMap is non synchronized.
  * Java HashMap maintains no order.
  * The initial default capacity of Java HashMap class is 16 with a load factor of 0.75.
